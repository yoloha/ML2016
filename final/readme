This repository contains the source codes of the contest 
               "ML2016 Cyber Security Attack Defender" 
< https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/ml2016-cyber-security-attack-defender >

Team Name: NTU_r05942042_R20? Daikin R32 is the new trend! A___________A
Rank: 1

Instructions:
	1. Make sure you're under the directory "final/"

	2. $ mkdir data

	3. Place "test.in", "train", "training_attack_types.txt" in "final/data/"
	   link: < https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/ml2016-cyber-security-attack-defender/data >

	4. $ cd src

	5. $ python parse.py
	   Make sure pandas is installed

	6.(a) To reproduce the Kaggle #1 results:
		$ python ents.py
	      Output files would be "final/pred_ents"

	6.(b) To try out the NN implementation of this task (quite crappy):
		$ python NN_sklearn.py
			or
		$ python NN_keras.py
	      Output file would be "final/pred_NN"

	6.(c) To try out the Decision tree(DT) implementation of this task (decent yet still poor)
		$ python DT.py
	      Output file would be "final/pred_DT"

	6.(d) To try out the random forest(RF) implementation of this task (not bad)
		$ python forest.py
	      Output file would be "final/pred_forest"

	6.(e) To generate one-hot coded data format (not used in Kaggle #1 submission)
		$ python parse_onehot.py
	      Output file would be "final/data/train2_p_nodup"

	6.(f) To perform ANOVA f-test feature analysis on dummy coded features
		$ python feature_analysis.py
	      Make sure matplotlib is installed
